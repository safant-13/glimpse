# Glimpse

> Glimpse into your IDEAS - Visualize code concepts instantly

Glimpse is an interactive web application that allows you to transform your ideas into visual code prototypes quickly. Simply describe what you want to create, and Glimpse will generate and render the code for you in real-time.

Below is an Example of the solution:

## üåü Features

- **Multi-framework Support**: Generate code in React, P5.js, or classic HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Live Preview**: See your code running in real-time
- **Code Editing**: Modify the generated code directly in the browser
- **AI-powered Suggestions**: Get intelligent recommendations to improve your code
- **Multiple AI Providers**: Support for OpenAI, Grok, and Gemini

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- API keys for at least one of the supported AI providers (OpenAI, Grok, or Gemini)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/glimpse.git
cd glimpse
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## üß† AI Integration
Glimpse supports multiple AI providers:

- OpenAI : Uses GPT-4o for high-quality code generation
- Grok : Uses Mixtral-8x7b-32768 for efficient code generation
- Gemini : Uses Gemini-1.5-Pro with fallback to Gemini-Pro
To use any provider, you'll need to obtain an API key from their respective platforms:

- OpenAI API Keys
- Grok API Access
- Google AI Studio (Gemini)
